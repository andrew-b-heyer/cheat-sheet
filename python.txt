Add a shebang line to the top of the script:

#!/usr/bin/env python

Mark the script as executable:

chmod +x myscript.py

Add the dir containing it to your PATH variable. (If you want it to stick, you'll have to do this in .bashrc or .bash_profile in your home dir.)

export PATH=/path/to/script:$PATH
