Getting started with docker changes a little bit depending on the 

# Centos 7 https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/

# first delete all the old Docker installations since they are outdated version
yum remove docker docker-common docker-selinux docker-engine

$ install the device driver for Centos7 which works well with Docker currently
yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2

# Install the updated docker CE version, should be version 20 or higher
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
yum install docker-ce
yum install docker-compose



# Building all container from new
docker-compose up --build
